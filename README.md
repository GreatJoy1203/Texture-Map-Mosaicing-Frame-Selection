Texture mosaicking
1.	Run “data_preparation.m”. It reads in all the useful information.
2.	Run “texture_mosaicing.m”. It generates the texture map.
3.	Run “writeOBJ.m”. It outputs an OBJ file which contains mesh and texture. Like writeOBJ(faces, vertexes, normals, uvmaps, 'test.obj')


Frame Selection
Run “FrameSelection_Calibration_Checkerboard.m” for checkerboard image selection
Run “FrameSelectionPlatform2_bladder.m” for general bladder image selection
